3. All project-related operations are only allowed within the active company.
4. Proper validation and error handling is required for every endpoint.
5. Use Laravel's built-in Validator facade for request validation.
6. All APIs must be tested via Postman


**Postman Testing Guide**
1. Set Authorization: Bearer <token> in headers for all authenticated requests.
2. Use Content-Type: application/json when sending raw JSON body.
